It is hard for scientists to know what to read and to read everything that is relevant.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"clearfix visible-lg-block\"></div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-5\">\r\n      <p><strong>You can help them</strong> by identifying key pieces of information in scientific text.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-7\">\r\n      <img src=\"/static/images/about/help-action.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n      <h2>How exactly does Mark2Cure work?</h2>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n      <p>Mark2Cure works by teaching citizen scientists to precisely identify concepts and concept relationships in biomedical text. This is a task that anyone can learn to do and can perform better than any known computer program.  Once these tasks are completed, advanced statistical algorithms take the data provided by the volunteers and use it to provide scientists with new tools for finding the information that they require within the sea of biomedical knowledge.</p>\r\n      <p>For example, scientists often have questions like \u201cHow might one disease, say Ebola, be related to another disease, say Dengue Fever?\u201d.  Such connections may not exist in any one scientific article.  By specifically identifying what diseases (and perhaps other concepts) are represented in each article, it may be possible to find hidden connections.  These hidden connections form the basis for most important new discoveries.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2 paragraph-box\">\r\n      <img src=\"/static/images/about/ebola_net.png\" style=\"padding: 6px;\" class=\"img-responsive\" />\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n      <h2>What are the goals of Mark2Cure?</h2>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n      <p>Ultimately, Mark2Cure aims to identify key terms in <strong>ALL</strong> biomedical research abstracts enabling researchers to identify new relationships and ideas that would otherwise remain hidden.</p>\r\n      <p><strong>However, every ambitious project needs an attainable starting goal.</strong></p>\r\n      <p>For Mark2Cure, this goal is to highlight concepts in rare genetic disease research literature. Historically, rare genetic disease researchers have relied heavily on patient communities and foundations to fund their work. Many of the discoveries on rare genetic diseases would not be possible without the highly active and extremely dedicated community of patients/parents of patients. Mark2Cure invites everyone, especially members of these communities, to help researchers spend less time studying research literature, and more time finding a cure.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n      <h2>Why should you join Mark2Cure?</h2>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Help advance biomedical research!</li>\r\n        <li>Improve your reading and reading comprehension skills!</li>\r\n        <li>Keep your mind sharp!</li>\r\n        <li>Influence the selection of future Mark2Cure biomedical research areas</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"row\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-xs-12\">\r\n      <h2>What is the Current Status of Mark2Cure?</h2>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n      <p>Mark2Cure is currently in Beta-Testing and will be tackling a corpus of rare genetic disease research papers in this phase.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",
