HPA has previously been shown to recognize aberrant O-linked alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine ( GalNAcalpha ) / mucin glycosylation in cancer , including exposed Tn epitopes . However , recent glycan-array analysis reported that diverse epitopes are also recognized by the lectin , e.g . consortium for functional glycomics ( CFG ) data : GalNAcalpha1,3Gal ; beta-GalNAc ; GlcNAcbeta1,4Gal . The intriguing observations from the CFG array led to this study , in which HPA-binding epitopes were localized and characterized in an in vitro model of breast cancer metastasis . HMT3522 ( benign disease ) , BT474 ( primary cancer ) and T47D / MCF7 ( metastatic cancer ) cells were assessed in confocal microscopy-based co-localization studies and a glycoproteomic analysis based on 2-dimensional electrophoresis ( 2DE ) , western blotting and mass spectrometry was adopted . HPA binding correlated with levels of integrin alpha6 , transcription factors heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein ( HnRNP ) H1 , HnRNP D-like , HnRNP A2 / B1 as well as heat shock protein 27 ( Hsp27 ) , glial fibrillary acidic protein and enolase 1 ( ENO1 ) . These glycoproteins were non-detectable in the non-metastatic breast cancer cell lines . The recognition of HnRNPs , Hsp27 and ENO1 by HPA correlated with O-GlcNAcylation of these proteins . Integrin alpha6 was the most abundant HPA glycoprotein in the breast cancer cells with a metastatic phenotype ; this concurred with previous findings in colorectal cancer . This is the first report in which HPA has been shown to bind O-GlcNAcylated transcription factors . This class of proteins represents a new means by which HPA differentiates cancer cells with an aggressive metastatic phenotype .", "updated": "2015-06-23T18:12:30Z", "source": "images/figure.jpg", "document": 1816}, "model": "document.section", "pk": 3632}, {"fields": {"kind": "t", "created": "2015-06-23T18:12:42Z", "text": "The effect of glycosylation on plasma N-terminal proBNP-76 levels in patients with heart or renal failure .", "updated": "2015-06-23T18:12:42Z", "source": "images/figure.jpg", "document": 1817}, "model": "document.section", "pk": 3633}, {"fields": {"kind": "a", "created": "2015-06-23T18:12:42Z", "text": "OBJECTIVE : Pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( proBNP ) -108 and N-terminal proBNP-76 ( NT-BNP ) contain seven sites for O-linked oligosaccharide attachment . Currently , levels of glycosylated NT-BNP are probably underestimated because it is not recognised by one antibody in the sandwich assay system . The pathophysiological significance of cardiac and plasma levels of non-glycosylated ( nonglyNT-BNP ) and glycosylated NT-BNP ( glyNT-BNP ) in heart failure ( HF ) and chronic renal failure ( CRF ) was investigated . METHODS : Plasma samples from 186 patients with HF and 76 patients with CRF on haemodialysis were studied , together with 11 atrial tissue samples . To measure nonglyNT-BNP and glyNT-BNP , samples were incubated with or without deglycosylating enzymes and NT-BNP was measured using Roche Elecsys proBNP I . The percentage glyNT-BNP was calculated as glyNT-BNP / ( glyNT-BNP + nonglyNT-BNP ) . RESULTS : In HF , plasma BNP , nonglyNT-BNP and glyNT-BNP levels all increased with increasing disease severity ( New York Heart Association class ; p < 0.0001 ) , though the molar ratio remained constant ( molar ratio , BNP : nonglyNT-BNP : glyNT-BNP = 1:2.4:9.6 ) . Before haemodialysis for CRF , plasma BNP and nonglyNT-BNP were somewhat elevated , and glyNT-BNP was markedly increased ( molar ratio , BNP : nonglyNT-BNP : glyNT-BNP = 1:8.5:82 ) . After haemodialysis , plasma BNP , nonglyNT-BNP , atrial natriuretic protein and cGMP all declined ( p < 0.0001 ) , but glyNT-BNP was unchanged . Notably , the percentage of glyNT-BNP was elevated before haemodialysis , and was further increased after haemodialysis ( p < 0.0001 ) . Atrial tissue levels of BNP , nonglyNT-BNP and glyNT-BNP were similar . CONCLUSION : THE findings suggest that most endogenous plasma NT-BNP is glycosylated and therefore undetectable with the current assay system , and that the relative glycosylation level is increased by haemodialysis .", "updated": "2015-06-23T18:12:42Z", "source": "images/figure.jpg", "document": 1817}, "model": "document.section", "pk": 3634}]
