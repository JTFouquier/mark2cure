        p.paragraph.results Does choice of insulin regimen really matter in the management of <span class="selected">diabetes</span>?  To assess the management of <span class="selected">diabetes</span>, we reviewed records of 20 <span class="selected">diabetes</span> patients.  Of the 20 <span class="selected">diabetes</span> patients, 17 had <span class="selected">type 2 diabetes mellitus</span>.  The remaining 3 had <span class="selected">inherited and/or type I diabetes mellitus</span>.  Of the 20 patients, 10 patients were also diagnosed with <span class="selected">heart disease</span> or <span class="selected">rheumatoid arthritis</span>.  We will discuss the effects of insulin regimen on <span class="selected">type 2 diabetes mellitus</span> patients (ie- <span class="selected">T2DM</span> patients) with or without <span class="selected">rheumatoid arthritis</span> (<span class="selected">RA</span>) or <span class="selected">heart disease</span> (<span class="selected">HD</span>).  In particular, we will examine the effects of these insulin regimen on the symptoms of the diseases.  We will focus on some common symptoms such as <span class="selected">fatigue</span> as well as <span class="selected">frequent urination</span>.  Another crucial symptom that we will investigate includes <span class="selected">tingling and/or numbness in the hands or feet</span>.
