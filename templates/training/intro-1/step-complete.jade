        p Does choice of insulin regimen really matter in the management of diabetes?  To assess the management of diabetes, we reviewed records of 20 diabetes patients.  Of the 20 diabetes patients, 17 had type 2 diabetes mellitus.  The remaining 3 had inherited and/or type I diabetes mellitus.  Of the 20 patients, 10 patients were also diagnosed with heart disease or rheumatoid arthritis.  We will discuss the effects of insulin regimen on type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (ie- T2DM patients) with or without rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or heart disease (HD).  In particular, we will examine the effects of these insulin regimen on the symptoms of the diseases.  We will focus on some common symptoms such as fatigue as well as frequent urination.  Another crucial symptom that we will investigate includes tingling sensations and/or numbness in the hands or feet.
