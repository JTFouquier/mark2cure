        p Recombinations in individuals homozygous by descent localize the Friedreich ataxia locus in a cloned 450-kb interval.

        p The locus for Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) , a severe neurodegenerative disease , is tightly linked to markers D9S5 and D9S15 , and analysis of rare recombination events has suggested the order cen-FRDA-D9S5-D9S15-qter . We report here the construction of a YAC contig extending 800 kb centromeric to D9S5 and the isolation of five new microsatellite markers from this region . In order to map these markers with respect to the FRDA locus , all within a 1-cM confidence interval , we sought to increase the genetic information of available FRDA families by considering homozygosity by descent and association with founder haplotypes in isolated populations . This approach allowed us to identify one phase-known recombination and one probable historic recombination on haplotypes from Reunion Island patients , both of which place three of the five markers proximal to FRDA . This represents the first identification of close FRDA flanking markers on the centromeric side . The two other markers allowed us to narrow the breakpoint of a previously identified distal recombination that is > 180 kb from D9S5 ( 26P ) . Taken together , the results place the FRDA locus in a 450-kb interval , which is small enough for direct search of candidate genes . A detailed rare cutter restriction map and a cosmid contig covering this interval were constructed and should facilitate the search of genes in this region . .
