        p Age at diagnosis as an indicator of eligibility for BRCA1 DNA testing in familial breast cancer.
        p We searched for criteria that could indicate breast cancer families with a high prior probability of being caused by the breast / ovarian cancer susceptibility locus BRCA1 on chromosome 17 . To this end , we performed a linkage study with 59 consecutively collected Dutch breast cancer families , including 16 with at least one case of ovarian cancer . We used an intake cut-off of at least three first-degree relatives with breast and / or ovarian cancer at any age . Significant evidence for linkage was found only among the 13 breast cancer families with a mean age at diagnosis of less than 45 years . An unexpectedly low proportion of the breast-ovarian cancer families were estimated to be linked to BRCA1 , which could be due to a founder effect in the Dutch population . Given the expected logistical problems in clinical management now that BRCA1 has been identified , we propose an interim period in which only families with a strong positive family history for early onset breast and / or ovarian cancer will be offered BRCA1 mutation testing . .
