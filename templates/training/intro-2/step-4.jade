        p MEFV-Gene analysis in armenian patients with Familial Mediterranean fever: diagnostic value and unfavorable renal prognosis of the M694V homozygous genotype-genetic and therapeutic implications.
      #quest-2.col-md-10.col-md-offset-1.paragraph.entity_tag
        p Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is a recessively inherited disorder that is common in patients of Armenian ancestry . To date , its diagnosis , which can be made only retrospectively , is one of exclusion , based entirely on nonspecific clinical signs that result from serosal inflammation and that may lead to unnecessary surgery . Renal amyloidosis , prevented by colchicine , is the most severe complication of FMF , a disorder associated with mutations in the MEFV gene . To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV-gene analysis , we investigated 90 Armenian FMF patients from 77 unrelated families that were not selected through genetic-linkage analysis . Eight mutations , one of which ( R408Q ) is new , were found to account for 93 % of the 163 independent FMF alleles , with both FMF alleles identified in 89 % of the patients . In several instances , family studies provided molecular evidence for pseudodominant transmission and incomplete penetrance of the disease phenotype . The M694V homozygous genotype was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of renal amyloidosis and arthritis , compared with other genotypes ( P = . 0002 and P = . 006 , respectively ) . The demonstration of both the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV analysis and particular modes of inheritance should lead to new ways for management of FMF-including genetic counseling and therapeutic decisions in affected families .
