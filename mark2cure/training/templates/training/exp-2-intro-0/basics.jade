            p Biomedical research literature is growing rapidly around the world, making it hard for researchers to acquire all new relevant information . By joining Mark2Cure I am helping to tag research articles so that they are readily searchable and can be linked to find new relationships, new discoveries, and hopefully new treatment strategies. I contribute to Mark2Cure because I am ready to help .
