8636252	X-Linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) is a genetic disease associated with demyelination of the central nervous system , adrenal insufficiency , and accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissue and body fluids . ALD is due to mutation of a gene located in Xq28 that encodes a peroxisomal transporter protein of unknown function . The most common phenotype of ALD is the cerebral form ( 45 % ) that develops in boys between 5-12 yr . Adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ) involves the spinal cord and peripheral nerves in young adults ( 35 % ) . Adrenal insufficiency ( Addisons disease ) is frequently associated with AMN or cerebral ALD and may remain the only clinical expression of ALD ( 8 % of cases ) . The prevalence of ALD among adults with Addisons disease remains unknown . To evaluate this prevalence , we performed biochemical analysis of very long chain fatty acids in 14 male patients ( age ranging from 12-45 yr at diagnosis ) previously diagnosed as having primary idiopathic adrenocortical insufficiency . In 5 of 14 patients ( 35 % ) , elevated plasma concentrations of very long chain fatty acids were detected . None of these patients had adrenocortical antibodies . By electrophysiological tests and magnetic resonance imaging it was determined that two patients had cerebral ALD , one had adrenomyeloneuropathy with cerebral involvement , and two had preclinical AMN . Our data support the hypothesis that ALD is a frequent cause of idiopathic Addisons disease in children and adults . . 	2.0	22.0	3.0	0.083333336	0.4	0.13793103	14.814815	ALD, 8, AMN, 3, disease, 3, Addisons, 3, Adrenomyeloneuropathy, 2, insufficiency, 1, adrenoleukodystrophy, 1, X-Linked, 1, 	demyelination of the central nervous system, 1, genetic disease, 1, adrenocortical insufficiency, 1, 	Adrenal insufficiency, 1, adrenal insufficiency, 1, 
8696339	Apoptosis has recently been recognized as a mode of cell death in Huntington disease ( HD ) . Apopain , a human counterpart of the nematode cysteine protease death-gene product , CED-3 , has a key role in proteolytic events leading to apoptosis . Here we show that apoptotic extracts and apopain itself specifically cleave the HD gene product , huntingtin . The rate of cleavage increases with the length of the huntingtin polyglutamine tract , providing an explanation for the gain-of-function associated with CAG expansion . Our results show that huntingtin is cleaved by cysteine proteases and suggest that HD might be a disorder of inappropriate apoptosis . . 	0.0	6.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	HD, 3, disease, 1, Huntington, 1, Huntington disease, 1, 	disorder of inappropriate apoptosis, 1, 	
8758207	To define the possible role of the VHL gene in the development of sporadic renal cell carcinomas , 91 different parenchymal tumours of the kidney have been investigated for mutation of the VHL gene by single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) and / or heteroduplex ( HD ) techniques . Chromosome 3p deletion was detected in 98 per cent of non-papillary renal cell carcinomas and in 25 per cent of chromophobe renal cell carcinomas . In 22 of the 43 non-papillary renal cell carcinomas , abnormally migrating DNA bands were detected by SSCP and / or HD analysis . No mobility shift was seen in any of the 23 chromophobe renal cell carcinomas . In addition , 15 papillary renal cell tumours and ten renal oncocytomas , which are characterized by genetic changes other than loss of chromosome 3p sequences , were analysed for mutation of the VHL gene . None of these tumours showed abnormal migration patterns . The results indicate that mutation of the VHL gene is associated exclusively with the development of non-papillary renal cell carcinoma . . 	1.0	17.0	1.0	0.055555556	0.5	0.099999994	10.526316	carcinomas, 5, renal cell carcinomas, 5, tumours, 2, carcinoma, 1, renal cell tumours, 1, parenchymal, 1, oncocytomas, 1, renal cell carcinoma, 1, 	parenchymal tumours of the kidney, 1, 	tumours, 1, 
8968716	BRCA1 mutations cause increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer , frequently of early onset . Many different mutations occur in BRCA1 , including several examples of recurrent mutations , each of which accounts for a significant number of families with heritable cancer predisposition . These common mutations have an etiological role in many breast and ovarian cancer cases and provide the opportunity to examine genotype-phenotype correlations and genotype-environment interactions in individuals with the identical BRCA1 lesion . We report a novel missense change in BRCA1 , 2640 C-- &gt; T ( R841W ) , found in 3 cases from a subject group of 305 breast and 79 ovarian cancer cases from Orange County , CA . These are consecutive , population-based cases not selected for age or family history . In all three cases , there is a strong family history of breast , ovarian , or other cancers possibly related to a BRCA1 defect and family members showed a high concordance of cancer incidence with the presence of R841W . The age of cancer onset was not always distinct from typical sporadic cases . Testing of a sample of 413 unrelated individuals to examine the hypothesis that R841W might be a rare polymorphism detected one additional instance in a woman with breast cancer diagnosed at age 77 years , and cancer in one parent . R841W is likely to be an etiologically significant lesion with involvement in close to 1 % ( 95 % confidence interval of 0-1 . 7 % ) of all breast and ovarian cancers in this population . 	0.0	24.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	cancer, 8, breast, 6, ovarian, 5, cancers, 2, breast and ovarian cancer, 2, ovarian cancer, 1, 	cancer, 1, 	
9122265	Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita is an inherited disorder of skeletal muscle caused by mutations in a voltage-gated Cl- channel gene ( CLCN1 , 7q35 ) . Here , we report that a mutation predicting the substitution of Gly 230 by glutamic acid ( G230E ) between segments D3 and D4 dramatically alters the pore properties of a recombinant human muscle Cl- channel ( hCIC-1 ) expressed in a mammalian cell line ( tsA201 ) . The G230E mutation causes substantial changes in anion and cation selectivity as well as a fundamental change in rectification of the current-voltage relationship . Whereas wild-type channels are characterized by pronounced inward rectification and a Cl &gt; thiocyanate &gt; Br &gt; NO ( 3 ) &gt; I &gt; CH ( 3 ) SO ( 3 ) selectivity , G230E exhibits outward rectification at positive potentials and a thiocyanate &gt; NO ( 3 ) &gt; I &gt; Br &gt; Cl &gt; CH ( 3 ) SO ( 3 ) selectivity . Furthermore , the cation-to-anion permeability ratio of the mutant is much greater than that of the wild-type channel . Voltage-dependent blocks by intracellular and extracellular iodide help to distinguish two distinct ion binding sites within the hClC-1 conduction pathway . Both binding sites are preserved in the mutant but have decreased affinities for iodide . These findings suggest that Gly 230 is critical for normal ion conductance in hClC-1 and that this residue resides within the channel pore . . 	0.0	3.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita, 1, myotonia, 1, congenita, 1, 	inherited disorder of skeletal muscle, 1, 	
8640236	Inherited mutant alleles of familial tumour suppressor genes predispose individuals to particular types of cancer . In addition to an involvement in inherited susceptibility to cancer , these tumour suppressor genes are targets for somatic mutations in sporadic cancers of the same type found in the familial forms . An exception is BRCA1 , which contributes to a significant fraction of familial breast and ovarian cancer , but undergoes mutation at very low rates in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers . This finding suggests that other genes may be the principal targets for somatic mutation in breast carcinoma . A second , recently identified familial breast cancer gene , BRCA2 ( refs 5-8 ) , accounts for a proportion of breast cancer roughly equal to BRCA1 . Like BRCA1 , BRCA2 behaves as a dominantly inherited tumour suppressor gene . Individuals who inherit one mutant allele are at increased risk for breast cancer , and the tumours they develop lose the wild-type allele by heterozygous deletion . The BRCA2 coding sequence is huge , composed of 26 exons that span 10 , 443 bp . Here we investigate the rate of BRCA2 mutation in sporadic breast cancers and in a set of cell lines that represent twelve other tumour types . Surprisingly , mutations in BRCA2 are infrequent in cancers including breast carcinoma . However , a probable germline mutation in a pancreatic tumour cell line suggests a role for BRCA2 in susceptibility to pancreatic cancer . . 	3.0	24.0	2.0	0.11111111	0.6	0.1875	20.689655	breast, 8, cancer, 5, cancers, 3, breast cancer, 3, breast carcinoma, 2, breast and ovarian cancers, 1, pancreatic cancer, 1, breast and ovarian cancer, 1, 	tumours, 1, sporadic cancers, 1, 	cancer, 2, cancers, 1, 
8589723	Women who carry a mutation in the BRCA1 gene ( on chromosome 17q21 ) , have an 80 % risk of breast cancer and a 40 % risk of ovarian cancer by the age of 70 ( ref . 1 ) . The variable penetrance of BRCA1 suggests that other genetic and non-genetic factors play a role in tumourigenesis in these individuals . The HRAS1 variable number of tandem repeats ( VNTR ) polymorphism , located 1 kilobase ( kb ) downstream of the HRAS1 proto-oncogene ( chromosome 11p15 . 5 ) is one possible genetic modifier of cancer penetrance . Individuals who have rare alleles of the VNTR have an increased risk of certain types of cancers , including breast cancer ( 2-4 ) . To investigate whether the presence of rare HRAS1 alleles increases susceptibility to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer , we have typed a panel of 307 female BRCA1 carriers at this locus using a PCR-based technique . The risk for ovarian cancer was 2 . 11 times greater for BRCA1 carriers harbouring one or two rare HRAS1 alleles , compared to carriers with only common alleles ( P = 0 . 015 ) . The magnitude of the relative risk associated with a rare HRAS1 allele was not altered by adjusting for the other known risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer ( 5 ) . Susceptibility to breast cancer did not appear to be affected by the presence of rare HRAS1 alleles . This study is the first to show the effect of a modifying gene on the penetrance of an inherited cancer syndrome 	1.0	20.0	1.0	0.04761905	0.5	0.08695652	9.090909	cancer, 9, ovarian cancer, 4, breast, 4, breast cancer, 3, 	inherited cancer syndrome, 1, 	cancers, 1, 
9072974	Mapping of homozygous deletions on human chromosome 10q23 has led to the isolation of a candidate tumor suppressor gene , PTEN , that appears to be mutated at considerable frequency in human cancers . In preliminary screens , mutations of PTEN were detected in 31 % ( 13 / 42 ) of glioblastoma cell lines and xenografts , 100 % ( 4 / 4 ) of prostate cancer cell lines , 6 % ( 4 / 65 ) of breast cancer cell lines and xenografts , and 17 % ( 3 / 18 ) of primary glioblastomas . The predicted PTEN product has a protein tyrosine phosphatase domain and extensive homology to tensin , a protein that interacts with actin filaments at focal adhesions . These homologies suggest that PTEN may suppress tumor cell growth by antagonizing protein tyrosine kinases and may regulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis through interactions at focal adhesions . . 	1.0	4.0	1.0	0.2	0.5	0.2857143	33.333332	prostate cancer, 1, glioblastoma, 1, breast cancer, 1, glioblastomas, 1, 	metastasis, 1, 	cancers, 1, 
8824873	The mutation underlying Huntington disease ( HD ) is CAG expansion in the first exon of the HD gene . In order to investigate the role of CAG expansion in the pathogenesis of HD , we have produced transgenic mice containing the full length human HD cDNA with 44 CAG repeats . By 1 year , these mice have no behavioral abnormalities and morphometric analysis at 6 ( one animal ) and 9 ( two animals ) months age revealed no changes . Despite high levels of mRNA expression , there was no evidence of the HD gene product in any of these transgenic mice . In vitro transfection studies indicated that the inclusion of 120 bp of the 5 UTR in the cDNA construct and the presence of a frameshift mutation at nucleotide 2349 prevented expression of the HD cDNA . These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of HD is not mediated through DNA-protein interaction and that presence of the RNA transcript with an expanded CAG repeat is insufficient to cause the disease . Rather , translation of the CAG is crucial for the pathogenesis of HD . In contrast to that seen in humans , the CAG repeat in these mice was remarkably stable in 97 meioses . This suggests that genomic sequences may play a critical role in influencing repeat instability . . 	0.0	9.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	HD, 8, Huntington disease, 1, 	behavioral abnormalities, 1, 	
8751855	The common hereditary forms of breast cancer have been largely attributed to the inheritance of mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes . However , it is not yet clear what proportion of hereditary breast cancer is explained by BRCA1 and BRCA2 or by some other unidentified susceptibility gene ( s ) . We describe the proportion of hereditary breast cancer explained by BRCA1 or BRCA2 in a sample of North American hereditary breast cancers and assess the evidence for additional susceptibility genes that may confer hereditary breast or ovarian cancer risk . Twenty-three families were identified through two high-risk breast cancer research programs . Genetic analysis was undertaken to establish linkage between the breast or ovarian cancer cases and markers on chromosomes 17q ( BRCA1 ) and 13q ( BRCA2 ) . Mutation analysis in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was also undertaken in all families . The pattern of hereditary cancer in 14 ( 61 % ) of the 23 families studied was attributed to BRCA1 by a combination of linkage and mutation analyses . No families were attributed to BRCA2 . Five families ( 22 % ) provided evidence against linkage to both BRCA1 and BRCA2 . No BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were detected in these five families . The BRCA1 or BRCA2 status of four families ( 17 % ) could not be determined . BRCA1 and BRCA2 probably explain the majority of hereditary breast cancer that exists in the North American population . However , one or more additional genes may yet be found that explain some proportion of hereditary breast cancer . . 	0.0	26.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	cancer, 9, breast, 7, breast cancer, 6, ovarian, 2, ovarian cancer, 2, 	hereditary cancer, 1, 	
9066888	Kniest dysplasia is a severe chondrodysplasia caused by the defective formation of type II collagen . We report about Dr . Kniest , who first described the condition in 1952 , and his patient , who , at the age of 50 years is severely handicapped with short stature , restricted joint mobility , and blindness but is mentally alert and leads an active life . Molecular analysis of the patients DNA showed a single base ( G ) deletion involving the GT dinucleotide at the start of intron 18 destroying a splice site of the COL2A1 gene . This is in accordance with molecular findings in other patients with Kniest dysplasia and confirms , in the original patient , that the disorder is caused by small inframe deletions often due to exon skipping as a result of COL2A1 splice site mutations . . 	1.0	2.0	5.0	0.33333334	0.16666667	0.22222224	25.0	Kniest dysplasia, 2, 	short stature, 1, restricted joint mobility, 1, blindness, 1, defective formation of type II collagen, 1, severely handicapped, 1, 	chondrodysplasia, 1, 
8929413	Transporter-facilitated uptake of serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT ) has been implicated in anxiety in humans and animal models and is the site of action of widely used uptake-inhibiting antidepressant and antianxiety drugs . Human 5-HT transporter ( 5-HTT ) gene transcription is modulated by a common polymorphism in its upstream regulatory region . The short variant of the polymorphism reduces the transcriptional efficiency of the 5-HTT gene promoter , resulting in decreased 5-HTT expression and 5-HT uptake in lymphoblasts . Association studies in two independent samples totaling 505 individuals revealed that the 5-HTT polymorphism accounts for 3 to 4 percent of total variation and 7 to 9 percent of inherited variance in anxiety-related personality traits in individuals as well as sibships . . 	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.5	0.5	0.5	66.666664	anxiety, 1, 	anxiety-related personality traits, 1, 	anxiety, 1, 
8789439	In order to elucidate the cellular and molecular processes which are involved in Norrie disease ( ND ) , we have used gene targeting technology to generate ND mutant mice . The murine homologue of the ND gene was cloned and shown to encode a polypeptide that shares 94 % of the amino acid sequence with its human counterpart . RNA in situ hybridization revealed expression in retina , brain and the olfactory bulb and epithelium of 2 week old mice . Hemizygous mice carrying a replacement mutation in exon 2 of the ND gene developed retrolental structures in the vitreous body and showed an overall disorganization of the retinal ganglion cell layer . The outer plexiform layer disappears occasionally , resulting in a juxtaposed inner and outer nuclear layer . At the same regions , the outer segments of the photoreceptor cell layer are no longer present . These ocular findings are consistent with observations in ND patients and the generated mouse line provides a faithful model for study of early pathogenic events in this severe X-linked recessive neurological disorder . . 	0.0	8.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	ND, 5, Norrie, 1, disease, 1, Norrie disease, 1, 	X-linked recessive neurological disorder, 1, 	
8649785	We report details of a family with classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome in which there is a mutation in codon 344 of the tumour suppressor gene TP53 . Codon 344 is a key residue within the tetramerisation domain , and the amino acid substitution of a proline for a leucine is predicted to have profound implications for tetramerisation and potentially DNA binding . This is the first report of a mutation at this residue in either sporadic tumours or in the germline and the first report of a germline mutation within the tetramerisation domain . The family does not appear to be remarkable in the spectrum of tumours , and there is loss of the wild-type allele in a leiomyosarcoma from the proband . A cell line has been established from the tumour of the proband and cytogenetic and molecular studies carried out , providing an extensive analysis in this family . . 	2.0	4.0	1.0	0.33333334	0.6666667	0.44444448	57.142857	Li-Fraumeni syndrome, 1, leiomyosarcoma, 1, tumour, 1, tumours, 1, 	sporadic tumours, 1, 	tumour, 1, tumours, 1, 
8782829	Many human tumours have length alterations in repetitive sequence elements . Although this microsatellite instability has been attributed to mutations in four DNA mismatch repair genes in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) kindreds , many sporadic tumours exhibit instability but no detectable mutations in these genes . It is therefore of interest to identify other genes that contribute to this instability . In yeast , mutations in several genes , including RTH and MSH3 , cause microsatellite instability . Thus , we screened 16 endometrial carcinomas with microsatellite instability for alterations in FEN1 ( the human homolog of RTH ) and in MSH3 ( refs 12-14 ) . Although we found no FEN1 mutations , a frameshift mutation in MSH3 was observed in an endometrial carcinoma and in an endometrial carcinoma cell line . Extracts of the cell line were deficient in repair of DNA substrates containing mismatches or extra nucleotides . Introducing chromosome 5 , encoding the MSH3 gene , into the mutant cell line increased the stability of some but not all microsatellites . Extracts of these cells repaired certain substrates containing extra nucleotides , but were deficient in repair of those containing mismatches or other extra nucleotides . A subsequent search revealed a second gene mutation in HHUA cells , a missense mutation in the MSH6 gene . Together the data suggest that the MSH3 gene encodes a product that functions in repair of some but not all pre-mutational intermediates , its mutation in tumours can result in genomic instability and , as in yeast , MSH3 and MSH6 are partially redundant for mismatch repair . . 	0.0	7.0	3.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	endometrial carcinoma, 2, endometrial carcinomas, 1, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, 1, hereditary, 1, HNPCC, 1, nonpolyposis, 1, 	tumours, 2, sporadic tumours, 1, 	
8898652	BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS  The chromosome region 18q21 has been shown to be frequently deleted in colorectal cancers , and such frequent allelic loss is a hallmark of the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene . The DPC4 gene , which is located at 18q21 , has been identified as a tumor-suppressor gene from examination of pancreatic cancers . The aim of the present study was to determine if it might also be altered in colorectal cancers . METHODS  Mutation analyses of the DPC4 gene were performed on complementary DNA samples from 31 primary colorectal cancer specimens using a combination of polymerase chain reaction , single-strand conformation polymorphism , and DNA sequencing . RESULTS  Four missense mutations producing amino acid substitutions and a somatic 12-base pair deletion in the coding region of the DPC4 gene were detected in the 31 cancers ( 16 % ; 5 of 31 ) . CONCLUSIONS  The DPC4 gene may play a role as a tumor-suppressor gene in a fraction of colorectal cancers ; however , while allelic loss at 18q21 is very often seen in colorectal cancers , only a minority show DPC4 mutations , suggesting that there might be another tumor-suppressor gene in this chromosome region . . 	0.0	1.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	colorectal cancer, 1, 	cancers, 1, 	
9241281	Mutations in atm and p53 cause the human cancer-associated diseases ataxia-telangiectasia and Li-Fraumeni syndrome , respectively . The two genes are believed to interact in a number of pathways , including regulation of DNA damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoints , apoptosis and radiation sensitivity , and cellular proliferation . Atm-null mice , as well as those null for p53 , develop mainly T-cell lymphomas , supporting the view that these genes have similar roles in thymocyte development . To study the interactions of these two genes on an organismal level , we bred mice heterozygous for null alleles of both atm and p53 to produce all genotypic combinations . Mice doubly null for atm and p53 exhibited a dramatic acceleration of tumour formation relative to singly null mice , indicating that both genes collaborate in a significant manner to prevent tumorigenesis . With respect to their roles in apoptosis , loss of atm rendered thymocytes only partly resistant to irradiation-induced apoptosis , whereas additional loss of p53 engendered complete resistance . This implies that the irradiation-induced atm and p53 apoptotic pathways are not completely congruent . Finally-and in contrast to prior predictions-atm and p53 do not appear to interact in acute radiation toxicity , suggesting a separate atm effector pathway for this DNA damage response and having implications for the prognosis and treatment of human tumours . . 	0.0	4.0	2.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	Li-Fraumeni syndrome, 1, Li-Fraumeni, 1, syndrome, 1, ataxia-telangiectasia, 1, 	cancer-associated diseases, 1, tumours, 1, 	
8644702	Nine different germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene were identified in 15 of 47 kindreds from southern Sweden , by use of SSCP and heteroduplex analysis of all exons and flanking intron region and by a protein-truncation test for exon 11 , followed by direct sequencing . All but one of the mutations are predicted to give rise to premature translation termination and include seven frameshift insertions or deletions , a nonsense mutation , and a splice acceptor site mutation . The remaining mutation is a missense mutation ( Cys61Gly ) in the zinc-binding motif . Four novel Swedish founding mutations were identified  the nucleotide 2595 deletion A was found in five families , the C 1806 T nonsense mutation in three families , the 3166 insertion TGAGA in three families , and the nucleotide 1201 deletion 11 in two families . Analysis of the intragenic polymorphism D17S855 supports common origins of the mutations . Eleven of the 15 kindreds manifesting BRCA1 mutations were breast-ovarian cancer families , several of them with a predominant ovarian cancer phenotype . The set of 32 families in which no BRCA1 alterations were detected included 1 breast-ovarian cancer kindred manifesting clear linkage to the BRCA1 region and loss of the wild-type chromosome in associated tumors . Other tumor types found in BRCA1 mutation / haplotype carriers included prostatic , pancreas , skin , and lung cancer , a malignant melanoma , an oligodendroglioma , and a carcinosarcoma . In all , 12 of 16 kindreds manifesting BRCA1 mutation or linkage contained ovarian cancer , as compared with only 6 of the remaining 31 families ( P &lt; . 001 ) . The present study confirms the involvement of BRCA1 in disease predisposition for a subset of hereditary breast cancer families often characterized by ovarian cancers . 	0.0	10.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	cancer, 7, breast, 3, 	tumors, 1, 	
9241282	Myotonic dystrophy , or dystrophia myotonica ( DM ) , is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3 untranslated region of the DMPK protein kinase gene on chromosome 19q13 . 3 ( refs 1-3 ) . Although the DM mutation was identified more than five years ago , the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this most prevalent form of hereditary adult neuromuscular disease remain elusive . Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a DNase l-hypersensitive site located adjacent to the repeats on the wild-type allele is eliminated by repeat expansion , indicating that large CTG-repeat arrays may be associated with a local chromatin environment that represses gene expression . Here we report that the hypersensitive site contains an enhancer element that regulates transcription of the adjacent DMAHP homeobox gene . Analysis of DMAHP expression in the cells of DM patients with loss of the hypersensitive site revealed a two- to fourfold reduction in steady-state DMAHP transcript levels relative to wild-type controls . Allele-specific analysis of DMAHP expression showed that steady-state transcript levels from the expanded allele were greatly reduced in comparison to those from the wild-type allele . Together , these results demonstrate that CTG-repeat expansions can suppress local gene expression and implicate DMAHP in DM pathogenesis . 	0.0	10.0	2.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	DM, 4, Myotonic, 1, Myotonic dystrophy, 1, dystrophy, 1, dystrophia, 1, myotonica, 1, dystrophia myotonica, 1, 	neuromuscular disease, 1, autosomal dominant multisystem disorder, 1, 	
8692963	One of the fundamental questions concerning expression and function of dimeric enzymes involves the impact of naturally occurring mutations on subunit assembly and heterodimer activity . This question is of particular interest for the human enzyme galactose-l-phosphate uridylyl-transferase ( GALT ) , impairment of which results in the inherited metabolic disorder galactosemia , because many if not most patients studied to date are compound heterozygotes rather than true molecular homozygotes . Furthermore , the broad range of phenotypic severity observed in these patients raises the possibility that allelic combination , not just allelic constitution , may play some role in determining outcome . In the work described herein , we have selected two distinct naturally occurring null mutations of GALT , Q188R and R333W , and asked the questions ( i ) what are the impacts of these mutations on subunit assembly , and ( ii ) if heterodimers do form , are they active ? To answer these questions , we have established a yeast system for the coexpression of epitope-tagged alleles of human GALT and investigated both the extent of specific GALT subunit interactions and the activity of defined heterodimer pools . We have found that both homodimers and heterodimers do form involving each of the mutant subunits tested and that both heterodimer pools retain substantial enzymatic activity . These results are significant not only in terms of their implications for furthering our understanding of galactosemia and GALT holoenzyme structure-function relationships but also because the system described may serve as a model for similar studies of other complexes composed of multiple subunits . . 	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	galactosemia, 2, 	inherited metabolic disorder, 1, 	
8968760	The ATM gene is responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) , characterized by cerebellar degeneration , immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition . A-T carriers were reported to be moderately cancer-prone . A wide variety of A-T mutations , most of which are unique to single families , were identified in various ethnic groups , precluding carrier screening with mutation-specific assays . However , a single mutation was observed in 32 / 33 defective ATM alleles in Jewish A-T families of North African origin , coming from various regions of Morocco and Tunisia . This mutation , 103C-- &gt; T , results in a stop codon at position 35 of the ATM protein . In keeping with the nature of this mutation , various antibodies directed against the ATM protein failed to defect this protein in patient cells . A rapid carrier detection assay detected this mutation in three out of 488 ATM alleles of Jewish Moroccan or Tunisian origin . This founder effect provides a unique opportunity for population-based screening for A-T carriers in a large Jewish community . . 	0.0	7.0	5.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	A-T, 5, cancer, 1, ataxia-telangiectasia, 1, 	cerebellar degeneration, 1, autosomal recessive disorder, 1, immunodeficiency, 1, cancer predisposition, 1, cancer-prone, 1, 	
9174057	The ARP gene encodes a highly conserved arginine-rich protein from chromosomal band 3p21 . 1 1 . At the cytogenetic level this region is frequently deleted in a variety of different solid tumors , although not in pancreatic cancer . We have reported the presence of a specific mutation ( ATG50-- &gt; AGG ) or deletion of codon 50 of the ARP gene in different tumor types ( Shridhar et al . , 1996 , 1996a ) . In the present study , we have observed mutations involving codon 50 in 11 of 37 pancreatic tumors . The frequency of codon 50 mutation is roughly the same in pancreatic tumors as in the other types of tumors previously examined . In addition , we have detected mutations at codon 51 in multiple PCR subclones in two other pancreatic tumors .

In the four polymorphic variants that have two point mutations , one of the mutations is always 376 A-- &gt; G ( 126 Asn-- &gt; Asp ) , which on its own gives rise to the nondeficient polymorphic variant , G6PD A . In a study of G6PD deficient patients who presented with clinical favism in Spain , we have found a new polymorphic variant that we have called G6PD Malaga , whose only abnormality is a 542 A-- &gt; T ( 181 Asp-- &gt; Val ) mutation . This is the same mutation as previously found in association with the mutation of G6PD A in the double mutant , G6PD Santamaria . G6PD Malaga is associated with enzyme deficiency ( class III ) , and the enzymic properties of G6PD Malaga and G6PD Santamaria are quite similar , indicating that in this case the effects of the two mutations are additive rather than synergistic . G6PD Santamaria might have been produced by recombination between G6PD A and G6PD Malaga ; however haplotype analysis , including the use of a new silent polymorphism , suggests that the same 542 A-- &gt; T mutation has taken place independently in a G6PD B gene to give G6PD Malaga and in a G6PD A gene to give G6PD Santamaria . These findings help to outline the relationship and evolution of mutations in the human G6PD locus . . 	0.0	0.0	1.0	NaN	0.0	NaN	0.0		enzyme deficiency, 1, 	
9019400	Recent work has identified a mouse gene ( tsg101 ) whose inactivation in fibroblasts results in cellular transformation and the ability to produce metastatic tumors in nude mice . Here , we report that the human homolog , TSG101 , which we isolated and mapped to chromosome 11 , bands 15 . 1-15 1-15 . 2 , a region proposed to contain tumor suppressor gene ( s ) , is mutated at high frequency in human breast cancer . In 7 of 15 uncultured primary human breast carcinomas , intragenic deletions were shown in TSG101 genomic DNA and transcripts by gel and sequence analysis , and mutations affecting two TSG101 alleles were identified in four of these cancers . No TSG101 defects were found in matched normal breast tissue from the breast cancer patients .

9028321	Programmed cell death ( or apoptosis ) is a physiological process essential to the normal development and homeostatic maintenance of the immune system . The Fas / Apo-1 receptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis , as demonstrated by lymphoproliferation in MRL-lpr / lpr mice and by the recently described autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ( ALPS ) in humans , both of which are due to mutations in the Fas gene . We describe a novel family with ALPS in which three affected siblings carry two distinct missense mutations on both the Fas gene alleles and show lack of Fas-induced apoptosis . The children share common clinical features including splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy , but only one developed severe autoimmune manifestations . In all three siblings , we demonstrated the presence of anergic CD3 + CD4-CD8- ( double negative , [ DN ] ) T cells ; moreover , a chronic lymphocyte activation was found , as demonstrated by the presence of high levels of HLA-DR expression on peripheral CD3 + cells and by the presence of high levels of serum activation markers such as soluble interleukin-2 receptor ( slL-2R ) and soluble CD30 ( sCD30 ) . . 	2.0	3.0	1.0	0.4	0.6666667	0.5	66.666664	ALPS, 2, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, 1, 	autoimmune manifestations, 1, 	splenomegaly, 1, lymphadenopathy, 1, 
8828602	Classical phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . Limitations of the current dietary treatment for PKU have led to the development of potential treatments based on somatic gene transfer . Three different vector systems have been examined . Vectors derived from a recombinant retrovirus or a DNA / protein complex can efficiently transduce the PAH cDNA into PAH-deficient hepatocytes in vitro , but the application of these vector systems is presently limited by their low transduction efficiency in vivo . In contrast , a vector derived from a recombinant adenovirus can restore 10 % -80 % of normal hepatic PAH activity into PAH-deficient mice , which completely normalizes serum phenylalanine levels . This treatment is transient and cannot be effectively re-administered due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies directed against the recombinant adenoviral vector . However , these findings suggest that PKU can be completely corrected by somatic gene therapy , and provide some direction for the future development of adenoviral vectors . . 	0.0	4.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	PKU, 3, phenylketonuria, 1, 	autosomal recessive disorder, 1, 	
8625410	The Rho family of GTPases control diverse biological processes , including cell morphology and mitogenesis . We have identified WASP , the protein that is defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) , as a novel effector for CDC42Hs , but not for the other Rho family members , Rac and Rho . This interaction is dependent on the presence of the G protein-binding domain . Cellular expression of epitope-tagged WASP produces clusters of WASP that are highly enriched in polymerized actin . This clustering is not observed with a C-terminally deleted WASP and is inhibited by coexpression with dominant negative CDC42Hs-N17 , but not with dominant negative forms of Rac or Rho . Thus , WASP provides a novel link between CDC42Hs and the actin cytoskeleton , which suggests a molecular mechanism for many of the cellular abnormalities in WAS . The WASP sequence contains two novel domains that are homologous to other proteins involved in action organization . . 	0.0	5.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	WAS, 2, syndrome, 1, Wiskott-Aldrich, 1, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, 1, 	cellular abnormalities, 1, 	
9083764	The Schwartz-Jampel syndrome ( SJS ; chondrodystrophic myotonia ; McK 255 , 800 ) is a recessively inherited condition defined by myotonia , short stature , and bone dysplasia . Genetic linkage between SJS and chromosomal region 1q36-34 has been observed in several families , but the gene has not yet been identified . We studied the clinical and radiological features in 81 patients from the literature and 5 own patients trying to identify distinct subgroups . In addition , we tested genetic linkage to the SJS locus on chromosome 1 in one family with two affected sibs . We found that a group of patients have mild skeletal changes which may be secondary consequences of myotonia , while another group of patients appear to have primary bone dysplasia with myotonia . Within this latter group , there are differences in age of manifestation , clinical course and pattern of bone changes . We tentatively isolate three different types of SJS  type 1A , usually recognized in childhood , with moderate bone dysplasia , corresponding to the original descriptions of Schwartz , Jampel and Aberfeld ; type 1B , similar to type 1A but recognizable at birth , with more pronounced bone dysplasia resembling Kniest dysplasia ; and type 2 , manifest at birth , with increased mortality and bone dysplasia resembling Pyle disease . Genetic analysis of the family with two sibs affected by SJS type 2 showed evidence against linkage to chromosome 1p36-34 . CONCLUSIONS  SJS is clinically and radiologically heterogeneous . The causes of heterogeneity are not known yet but are likely to include both different mutations at the SJS locus on chromosome 1 and the presence of a second SJS locus . A tentative clinico-radiological classification can be useful for the characterization of patients and the development of genotype-phenotype correlations . . 	6.0	11.0	4.0	0.3529412	0.6	0.44444448	57.142857	SJS, 8, Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, 1, chondrodystrophic myotonia, 1, myotonia, 1, 	bone dysplasia, 2, short stature, 1, recessively inherited condition, 1, 	bone dysplasia, 3, myotonia, 3, 
8938427	Over 100 distinct disease-associated mutations have been identified in the breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 . Loss of the wild-type allele in &gt; 90 % of tumors from patients with inherited BRCA1 mutations indicates tumor suppressive function . The low incidence of somatic mutations suggests that BRCA1 inactivation in sporadic tumors occurs by alternative mechanisms , such as interstitial chromosomal deletion or reduced transcription . To identify possible features of the BRCA1 genomic region that may contribute to chromosomal instability as well as potential transcriptional regulatory elements , a 117 , 143-bp DNA sequence encompassing BRCA1 was obtained by random sequencing of four cosmids identified from a human chromosome 17 specific library . The 24 exons of BRCA1 span an 81-kb region that has an unusually high density of Alu repetitive DNA ( 41 . 5 % ) , but relatively low density ( 4 . 8 % ) of other repetitive sequences . BRCA1 intron lengths range in size from 403 bp to 9 . 2 kb and contain the intragenic microsatellite markers D17S1323 , D17S1322 , and D17S855 , which localize to introns 12 , 19 , and 20 , respectively . In addition to BRCA1 , the contig contains two complete genes  Rho7 , a member of the rho family of GTP binding proteins , and VAT1 , an abundant membrane protein of cholinergic synaptic vesicles . Partial sequences of the 1A1-3B B-box protein pseudogene and IFP 35 , an interferon induced leucine zipper protein , reside within the contig . An L21 ribosomal protein pseudogene is embedded in BRCA1 intron 13 .

8674108	Mutations of the BRCA1 gone in humans are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers . We show here that Brca1 + / - mice are normal and fertile and lack tumors by age eleven months . Homozygous Brca1 ( 5-6 ) mutant mice die before day 7 . 5 of embryogenesis . Mutant embryos are poorly developed , with no evidence of mesoderm formation . The extraembryonic region is abnormal , but aggregation with wild-type tetraploid embryos does not rescue the lethality . In vivo , mutant embryos do not exhibit increased apoptosis but show reduced cell proliferation accompanied by decreased expression of cyclin E and mdm-2 , a regulator of p53 activity . The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is dramatically increased in the mutant embryos . Buttressing these in vivo observations is the fact that mutant blastocyst growth is grossly impaired in vitro . Thus , the death of Brca1 ( 5-6 ) mutant embryos prior to gastrulation may be due to a failure of the proliferative burst required for the development of the different germ layers . 	0.0	4.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	cancers, 1, breast and ovarian cancers, 1, ovarian, 1, breast, 1, 	tumors, 1, 	
8929264	BACKGROUND  Allelic loss of chromosome 18q predicts a poor outcome in patients with stage II colorectal cancer . Although the specific gene inactivated by this allelic loss has not been elucidated , the DCC ( deleted in colorectal cancer ) gene is a candidate . We investigated whether the expression of the DCC protein in tumor cells is a prognostic marker in colorectal carcinoma . METHODS  The expression of DCC was evaluated immunohistochemically in 132 paraffin-embedded samples from patients with curatively resected stage II and III colorectal carcinomas . The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to adjust for covariates including age , sex , tumor site , degree of tumor differentiation , and use of adjuvant therapy . RESULTS  The expression of DCC was a strong positive predictive factor for survival in both stage II and stage III colorectal carcinomas . In patients with stage II disease whose tumors expressed DCC , the five-year survival rate was 94 . 3 percent , whereas in patients with DCC-negative tumors , the survival rate was 61 . 6 percent ( P &lt; 0 . 001 ) . In patients with stage III disease , the respective survival rates were 59 . 3 percent and 33 . 2 percent ( P = 0 . 03 ) . CONCLUSIONS  DCC is a prognostic marker in patients with stage II or stage III colorectal cancer . In stage II colorectal carcinomas , the absence of DCC identifies a subgroup of patients with lesions that behave like stage III cancers . These findings may thus have therapeutic implications in this group of patients 	0.0	0.0	2.0	NaN	0.0	NaN	0.0		stage III cancers, 1, tumors, 1, 	
9056547	We report a G-- &gt; A transition at nucleotide 431 of the proteolipid protein gene ( PLP ) results in a nonsense codon in a family with an unusual form of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease ( PMD ) . The mutation , which creates a second AluI restriction site , results in a nonsense mutation in PLP . The clinical picture resembles somewhat that of X-linked spastic paraplegia ( SPG ) . It differs from this and both the classical and connatal forms of PMD in that it is relatively mild in form , onset is delayed beyond age 2 years , nystagmus is absent , tremors are prominent , mental retardation is not severe , some patients show dementia or personality disorders , the disease is progressive rather than static in some , and several females show signs of disease .

9223307	A gene mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) , ATM , was recently identified by positional cloning . ATM is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase superfamily , some of which are protein kinases and appear to have important roles in cell cycle control and radiation signal transduction . We describe herein , to our knowledge , for the first time , the cloning of a full-length cDNA for ATM and correction of multiple aspects of the radio-sensitive phenotype of A-T cells by transfection with this cDNA . Overexpression of ATM cDNA in A-T cells enhanced the survival of these cells in response to radiation exposure , decreased radiation-induced chromosome aberrations , reduced radio-resistant DNA synthesis , and partially corrected defective cell cycle checkpoints and induction of stress-activated protein kinase . This correction of the defects in A-T cells provides further evidence of the multiplicity of effector functions of the ATM protein and suggests possible approaches to gene therapy . . 	0.0	5.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	A-T, 4, ataxia-telangiectasia, 1, 	genetic disorder, 1, 	
8931701	The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) , an X-linked immunodeficiency disease caused by mutation in the recently isolated gene encoding WAS protein ( WASP ) , is known to be associated with extensive clinical heterogeneity . Cumulative mutation data have revealed that WASP genotypes are also highly variable among WAS patients , but the relationship of phenotype with genotype in this disease remains unclear . To address this issue we characterized WASP mutations in 24 unrelated WAS patients , including 18 boys with severe classical WAS and 6 boys expressing mild forms of the disease , and then examined the degree of correlation of these as well as all previously published WASP mutations with disease severity . By analysis of these compiled mutation data , we demonstrated clustering of WASP mutations within the four most N-terminal exons of the gene and also identified several sites within this region as hotspots for WASP mutation . These characteristics were observed , however , in both severe and mild cases of the disease . Similarly , while the cumulative data revealed a predominance of missense mutations among the WASP gene lesions observed in boys with isolated thrombocytopenia , missense mutations were not exclusively associated with milder WAS phenotypes , but also comprised a substantial portion ( 38 % ) of the WASP gene defects found in patients with severe disease . These findings , as well as the detection of identical WASP mutations in patients with disparate phenotypes , reveal a lack of phenotype concordance with genotype in WAS and thus imply that phenotypic outcome in this disease cannot be reliably predicted solely on the basis of WASP genotypes . . 	0.0	11.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	WAS, 7, syndrome, 1, Wiskott-Aldrich, 1, thrombocytopenia, 1, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, 1, 	X-linked immunodeficiency disease, 1, 	
9272171	We examined galactosylceramidase ( GALC ) cDNA in four Japanese patients with adult onset globoid cell leukodystrophy ( Krabbe disease ; AO-GLD ) by polymerase chain reaction / single-strand conformation polymorphism ( PCR-SSCP ) analysis , subsequent sequence determination , and restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products , initial symptoms were the onset of slowly progressive spastic paraplegia from the middle of the second decade , and all patients had diminished GALC activity in their leukocytes . We identified three missense mutations ( I66M , G270D , L618S ) and one exon-6 skipping ( 535-573del ) . Two of the patients had only the I66M mutant mRNA , and one only the G27OD mutant mRNA . The fourth patient carried a compound heterozygous mutation of 535-573del and L618S . To determine the enzymatic activities produced by these mutations , we constructed mutated GALC cDNAs and expressed them in COS-1 cells . Three mutations , viz . , G270D , L618S , and exon-6 skipping ( 535-573del ) , produced diminished GALC activity as expected . The I66M mutation in the wild-type GALC cDNA ( I289 ) had normal activity , but when this mutation and the V289 polymorphism were introduced into the same allele , it had decreased activity . Thus , the combination of a unique mutation and polymorphism causes conformational change in the GALC enzyme , resulting in low enzymatic activity . AO-GLD mutations , including those found here , are located in the N-terminus ( I66M , G270D , 535-573del ) or C-terminus ( L618S ) of the GALC enzyme , whereas the reported mutations in the infantile form ( IF-GLD ) are in the central domain .

8666397	The mouse WASP gene , the homolog of the gene mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome , has been isolated and sequenced . the predicted amino acid sequence is 86 % identical to the human WASP sequence . A distinct feature of the mouse gene is an expanded polymorphic GGA trinucleotide repeat that codes for polyglycine and varies from 15 to 17 triplets in different Mus musculus strains . The genomic structure of the mouse WASP gene is expressed as an approximately 2 . 4-kb mRNA in thymus and spleen . Chromosomal mapping in an interspecific M . Musculus / M . spretus backcross placed the Wasp locus near the centromere of the mouse X chromosome , inseparable from Gata1 , Tcfe3 , and scurfy ( sf ) . This localization makes Wasp a candidate for involvement in scurfy , a T cell-mediated fatal lymphoreticular disease of mice that has previously been proposed as a mouse homolog of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome .

8812423	A major cytogenetic subgroup of lipomas is characterized by recurrent chromosome aberrations , mainly translocations , that involve chromosome segment 12q13-q15 . Multiple chromosomes have been found as the translocation partners of chromosome 12 but 3q27-q28 is preferentially involved . In previous studies , it has been shown that the high mobility group ( HMG ) protein gene HMGIC at 12q15 is consistently rearranged as a consequence of these translocations . Here , we report the identification and characterization of the chromosome 3-derived translocation partner gene , which we have designated LPP ( lipoma preferred partner gene ) . Using 3-RACE analysis of HMGIC fusion transcripts in lipoma cell line Li-501 / SV40 , ectopic genetic sequences were obtained , which by CASH ( chromosome assignment using somatic cell hybrids ) and FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) analysis were found to originate from chromosome segment 3q27-q28 . In Northern blot analysis , an mRNA of over 10 kb was detected by these ectopic sequences in a variety of human tissues but not in brain and peripheral blood leukocytes . Upon partial cDNA cloning , features of the genetic organization of LPP were established . The gene was found to span a genomic region of over 400 kb . Nucleotide sequence analysis of a composite cDNA of LPP revealed an open reading frame of 1836 nucleotides encoding a proline-rich protein containing a leucine-zipper motif in its amino-terminal region and three LIM domains in its carboxy-terminal region . The LPP-encoded protein should be classified as a novel member of the group 3 proteins of the LIM protein gene family . Using reverse transcriptase combined with polymerase chain reactions in the analysis of a number of lipoma cell lines and primary lipomas , it appeared that LPP is frequently rearranged also in cases without a cytogenetically detectable involvement of 3q27-q28 . Two alternative HMGIC / LPP hybrid transcripts have been detected ; the difference between them is mainly the presence of either two or three LIM domains in the predicted HMGI-C / LPP fusion proteins . . 	1.0	4.0	1.0	0.2	0.5	0.2857143	33.333332	lipoma, 3, lipomas, 1, 	primary lipomas, 1, 	lipomas, 1,

We have determined the genomic organization of CHRNA4 , which consists of six exons distributed over approximately 17 kb of genomic DNA . The nucleotide sequence obtained from the genomic regions adjacent to the exon boundaries enabled us to develop a set of primer pairs for PCR amplification of the complete coding region .

8931709	Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is an inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps predominantly in the colorectal region .

Mutations at the 5 end of APC are known to be associated with a relatively mild form of the disease , called attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli ( AAPC ) .

Western blot analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from affected family members from this kindred , as well as from a previously reported Swiss family carrying a frameshift mutation at codon 1987 and displaying a similar attenuated phenotype , showed only the wild-type APC protein .

Adult Dmpk- / -mice show ultrastructural changes in muscle and a 50 % decrease in force generation compared to young mice .

8843194	ATM , the gene mutated in the inherited human disease ataxia-telangiectasia , is a member of a family of kinases involved in DNA metabolism and cell-cycle checkpoint control . To help clarify the physiological roles of the ATM protein , we disrupted the ATM gene in mice through homologous recombination . Initial evaluation of the ATM knockout animals indicates that inactivation of the mouse ATM gene recreates much of the phenotype of ataxia-telangiectasia . The homozygous mutant ( ATM- / - ) mice are viable , growth-retarded , and infertile . The infertility of ATM- / - mice results from meiotic failure . Meiosis is arrested at the zygotene / pachytene stage of prophase I as a result of abnormal chromosomal synapsis and subsequent chromosome fragmentation . Immune defects also are evident in ATM- / - mice , including reduced numbers of B220 + CD43- pre-B cells , thymocytes , and peripheral T cells , as well as functional impairment of T-cell-dependent immune responses . The cerebella of ATM- / - mice appear normal by histologic examination at 3 to 4 months and the mice have no gross behavioral abnormalities . The majority of mutant mice rapidly develop thymic lymphomas and die before 4 months of age .

8954016	Hereditary hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome ( HPT-JT ) is an autosomal dominant disease ( OMIM 145001 ) that has recently been mapped to chromosomal region 1q21-q32 ( HRPT2 ) . Here we report two families with HPT-JT syndrome in which adult renal hamartomas or cystic kidney disease were prominent associated features , possibly representing a new phenotypic variant of the HPT-JT syndrome . In the first family , renal lesions were present in five out of six affected individuals , whereas HPT and JT were seen in four and two cases , respectively . In the second family , JT was found in three of the five affected individuals and two affected members also exhibited polycystic kidney disease . The possibility of the latter cosegregating as a separate autosomal dominant gene can not be ruled out . A sex-dependent penetrance of primary HPT , resulting in predominantly male-affected cases was evident in the two families . Twenty microsatellite markers in the HRPT2 region were typed , in addition to markers in the multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN ) types 1 and 2 regions at 11q13 and 10q11 . The disease in these two kindreds was linked to five markers in the 1q21-q32 region ( logarithm-of-odds scores  3 . 2-4 2-4 . 2 ) , whereas linkage to the MEN1 and MEN2 regions was excluded . Meiotic recombinations detected in affected individuals placed the locus telomeric of D1S215 , thus narrowing the HRPT2 region from &gt; 60 to approximately 34 centimorgans . Loss of heterozygosity was studied in seven renal hamartomas from two affected individuals in the first family , as well as in a jaw tumor and a parathyroid tumor from the second family . All renal hamartomas showed loss of heterozygosity at the 1q21-q32 region . The losses invariably involved the wild type allele derived from the unaffected parent , suggesting the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene in this region 	1.0	19.0	2.0	0.05	0.33333334	0.08695652	9.090909	JT, 5, HPT, 5, renal hamartomas, 3, HPT-JT, 3, polycystic kidney disease, 1, Hereditary hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, 1, hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, 1, 	autosomal dominant disease, 1, renal lesions, 1, 	cystic kidney disease, 1,

Fluorescence in situ hybridisation ( FISH ) studies with distal 11p13 specific cosmids showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint lay between the aniridia ( PAX6 ) locus and a region approximately 100 kb distal to PAX6 defined by the cosmid FO2121 . Although this patient did not have a detectable deletion within PAX6 , her aniridia may have resulted from a disruption of the distal chromatin domain containing either enhancers or regulators for PAX6 . This case may therefore be another example of aniridia caused by a position effect as recently described in two familial aniridia patients in which the phenotype cosegregated with chromosome abnormalities with 11p13 breakpoints . . 	0.0	6.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	aniridia, 5, sporadic aniridia, 1, 	chromosome abnormalities, 1, 	
8651278	We have searched for germ-line RB1 mutations in 119 patients with hereditary retinoblastoma . Previous investigations by Southern blot hybridization and PCR fragment-length analysis had revealed mutations in 48 patients . Here we report on the analysis of the remaining 71 patients . By applying heteroduplex analysis , nonisotopic SSCP , and direct sequencing , we detected germ-line mutations resulting in premature termination codons or disruption of splice signals in 51 ( 72 % ) of the 71 patients . Four patients also showed rare sequence variants . No region of the RB1 gene was preferentially involved in single base substitutions . Recurrent transitions were observed at most of the 14 codons within the RB1 . No mutation was observed in exons 25-27 , although this region contains two CGA codons . This suggests that mutations within the 3-terminal region of the RB1 gene may not be oncogenic . When these data were combined with the results of our previous investigations , mutations were identified in a total of 99 ( 83 % ) of 119 patients . The spectrum comprises 15 % large deletions , 26 % small length alterations , and 42 % base substitutions . No correlation between the location of frameshift or nonsense mutations and phenotypic features , including age at diagnosis , the number of tumor foci , and manifestation of nonocular tumors was observed . . 	0.0	2.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	retinoblastoma, 1, hereditary, 1, 	nonocular tumors, 1, 	
9195227	In the present study , leukocyte DNA from 143 patients with familial clustering of breast and / or ovarian cancer and tumour DNA from 96 breast carcinomas were screened for base mutations in the estrogen receptor gene ( ESR ) . Three patients with a family history of cancer were carrying a Gly160Cys germline substitution . This alteration was also detected in eight ( four females and four males ) of 729 controls ( 366 female , 363 males ) , indicating that the substitution probably represents a polymorphism . However , in the 229 female controls in whom family history of cancer was known , one of two who had a sister with breast cancer was carrying the variant allele . Hence , a possible clinical significance of the glycine into cysteine cannot be completely ruled out and should be further investigated . Somatic mutations were not detected in any of the tumours studied , and the present data do not provide support for somatic ESR base mutations as an important mechanism for hormonal therapy resistance in estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinomas . . 	2.0	12.0	1.0	0.14285715	0.6666667	0.23529413	26.666666	breast, 4, cancer, 3, breast carcinomas, 2, breast and / or ovarian cancer, 1, ovarian cancer, 1, tumour, 1, 	cancer , 1, 	cancer, 1, tumours, 1, 
8894695	Complete hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase ( HPRT ) deficiency in humans results in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome which is characterized , among other features , by compulsive self-injurious behavior . HPRT-deficient mice generated using mouse embryonic stem cells exhibit none of the behavioral symptoms associated with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome . Administration of drugs that inhibit adenine phosphoribosyltransferase ( APRT ) in HPRT-deficient mice has produced the suggestion that deficiency of APRT in combination with HPRT-deficiency in mice may lead to self-mutilation behavior [ C . L . Wu and D . W . Melton ( 1993 ) Nature Genet . 3 , 235-240 ] . To test this proposition , we bred HPRT-APRT-deficient mice . Although the doubly-deficient mice excrete adenine and its highly insoluble derivative , 2 , 8-dihydroxyadenine , which are also associated with human APRT deficiency , additional abnormalities or any self-injurious behavior were not detected . Thus , APRT-HPRT-deficient mice , which are devoid of any purine salvage pathways , show no novel phenotype and are not a model for the behavioral abnormalities associated with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome as previously suggested 	0.0	11.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	HPRT, 6, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, 3, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase ( HPRT ) deficiency, 1, HPRT-deficient, 1, 	behavioral abnormalities, 1, 	
8892662	Complement C7 deficiency ( C7D ) is associated frequently with recurrent bacterial infections , especially meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis . We report in this work the molecular bases of C7D in two unrelated Japanese males . We used exon-specific PCR / single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis as a screening step for mutations . Subsequent direct sequencing of the target exons identified homozygous mutations in exon 16 of case 1 and in exon 15 of case 2 . The mutation of case 1 was a homozygous T to A transversion at nucleotide 2250 , the third nucleotide of the codon TGT for Cys728 , leading to a stop codon TGA ( C728X ) . In case 2 , a homozygous 2-bp deletion ( 2137delTG / 2138delGT / 2139delTG ) caused a frameshift , generating a premature termination codon 4 to 6 nucleotides downstream . Family study in case 1 confirmed the genetic nature of the defect . Moreover , we detected a novel polymorphism in intron 11 that presumably is linked to the mutation responsible for C7D in case 1 . Our results indicate that the pathogenesis of C7D is heterogeneous like most of the other deficiencies of complement components . . 	1.0	5.0	2.0	0.16666667	0.33333334	0.22222224	25.0	C7D, 4, Complement C7 deficiency, 1, 	deficiencies of complement components, 1, bacterial infections, 1, 	meningitis, 1, 
8689689	Aniridia in man and Small eye in mice are semidominant developmental disorders caused by mutations within the paired box gene PAX6 . Whereas heterozygotes suffer from iris hypoplasia , homozygous mice lack eyes and nasal cavities and exhibit brain abnormalities . To investigate the role of gene dosage in more detail , we have generated yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice carrying the human PAX6 locus . When crossed onto the Small eye background , the transgene rescues the mutant phenotype . Strikingly , mice carrying multiple copies on a wild-type background show specific developmental abnormalities of the eye , but not of other tissues expressing the gene . Thus , at least five different eye phenotypes are associated with changes in PAX6 expression . We provide evidence that not only reduced , but also increased levels of transcriptional regulators can cause developmental defects . . 	0.0	2.0	4.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	Aniridia, 1, hypoplasia, 1, 	brain abnormalities, 1, semidominant developmental disorders, 1, developmental defects, 1, developmental abnormalities of the eye, 1, 	
9223312	Chromosomal translocations identified in hematopoietic and solid tumors result in deregulated expression of protooncogenes or creation of chimeric proteins with tumorigenic potential . In the pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , a consistent t ( 2 ; 13 ) ( q35 ; q14 ) or variant t ( 1 ; 13 ) ( p36 ; q14 ) translocation generates PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins , respectively . In this report , we demonstrate that in addition to functional alterations these translocations are associated with fusion product overexpression . Furthermore , PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR overexpression occurs by distinct mechanisms . Transcription of PAX3-FKHR is increased relative to wild-type PAX3 by a copy number-independent process . In contrast , PAX7-FKHR overexpression results from fusion gene amplification . Thus , gene-specific mechanisms were selected to overexpress PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , presumably due to differences in regulation between the wild-type loci . We postulate that these overexpression mechanisms ensure a critical level of gene product for the oncogenic effects of these fusions . . 	0.0	6.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	alveolar, 2, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, 2, rhabdomyosarcoma, 2, 	solid tumor, 1, 	
9012404	A population-based series of 54 male breast cancer cases from Southern California were analyzed for germ-line mutations in the inherited breast / ovarian cancer genes , BRCA1 and BRCA2 . Nine ( 17 % ) of the patients had a family history of breast and / or ovarian cancer in at least one first-degree relative . A further seven ( 13 % ) of the patients reported breast / ovarian cancer in at least one second-degree relative and in no first-degree relatives . No germ-line BRCA1 mutations were found . Two male breast cancer patients ( 4 % of the total ) were found to carry novel truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene . Only one of the two male breast cancer patients carrying a BRCA2 mutation had a family history of cancer , with one case of ovarian cancer in a first-degree relative . The remaining eight cases ( 89 % ) of male breast cancer with a family history of breast / ovarian cancer in first-degree relatives remain unaccounted for by mutations in either the BRCA1 gene or the BRCA2 gene . . 	0.0	25.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NaN	0.0	breast, 8, ovarian cancer, 5, male breast cancer, 4, breast cancer, 4, breast / ovarian cancer, 3, breast and / or ovarian cancer, 1, 	cancer, 1, 	
8931695	Mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter gene DTDST have been associated with a family of chondrodysplasias that comprises , in order of increasing severity , diastrophic dysplasia ( DTD ) , atelosteogenesis type 2 ( AO2 ) , and achondrogenesis type 1B ( ACG1B ) . To learn more about the molecular basis of DTDST chondrodysplasias and about genotype-phenotype correlations , we studied fibroblast cultures of three new patients  one with AO-2 , one with DTD , and one with an intermediate phenotype ( AO2 / DTD ) . Reduced incorporation of inorganic sulfate into macromolecules was found in all three . Each of the three patients was found to be heterozygous for a c862t transition predicting a R279W substitution in the third extracellular loop of DTDST . In two patients ( DTD and AO2 / DTD ) , no other structural mutation was found , but polymerase chain reaction amplification and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of fibroblast cDNA showed reduced mRNA levels of the wild-type DTDST allele  these two patients may be compound heterozygotes for the " Finnish " mutation ( as yet uncharacterized at the DNA level ) , which causes reduced expression of DTDST . The third patient ( with AO2 ) had the R279W mutation compounded with a novel mutation , the deletion of cytosine 418 ( delta c418 ) , predicting a frameshift with premature termination . Also the delta c418 allele was underrepresented in the cDNA , in accordance with previous observations that premature stop codons reduce mRNA levels . The presence of the DTDST R279W mutation in a total of 11 patients with AO2 or DTD emphasizes the overlap between these conditions . This mutation has not been found so far in 8 analyzed ACG1B patients , suggesting that it allows some residual activity of the sulfate transporter . . 	1.0	9.0	0.0	0.1	1.0	0.18181819	20.0	DTD, 6, diastrophic dysplasia, 2, chondrodysplasias, 1, 		chondrodysplasias, 1,
